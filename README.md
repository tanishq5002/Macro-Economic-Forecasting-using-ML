# ðŸ“ˆ GDP Forecasting with LSTM (India, 1960â€“2020)

This project applies a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to forecast India's GDP using historical data from 1960 to 2020.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

- `India_GDP_LSTM_Forecast (2).ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with model code and visualization
- `Countries GDP 1960-2020.csv`: Dataset used for training and evaluation
- `docs/SML PBL REPORT.pdf` & `docs/SML PBL REPORT.docx`: Report documentation

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

- **Technique**: LSTM (Recurrent Neural Network)
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow / Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Goal**: Predict future GDP values based on historical economic data

## ðŸ§ª How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab
2. Make sure required libraries are installed (`tensorflow`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, etc.)
3. Run each cell step-by-step to view results

## ðŸ“Œ Note

This project focuses on univariate time series forecasting and demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to macroeconomic indicators.
